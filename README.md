- Polyglot programmer learning by reinventing the wheel
- Below I have shown my reinventions and implementations

## Reinventions

- [ddaio](https://github.com/DineshDevaraj/ddaio) - Python based event loop. A drop in replacement for Python's built-in asyncio.
- ddanl - Python based async network library. A drop in replacement for twisted.
- ddawf - Python based async web development framework. A drop in replacement for FastAPI.
- [ddjson](https://github.com/DineshDevaraj/ddjson) - C++ based JSON parser implemented using (RDP) recursive decendant parsing.
- ddproxy - Python based UDP proxy

## Indigenous Ideas

- [ddpnx](https://github.com/DineshDevaraj/ddjson) - C++ based reverse regex engine implemented using Yacc and Bison.
