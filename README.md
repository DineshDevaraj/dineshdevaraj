- Polyglot programmer, learner by reinventing the wheel
- Below I have shown my (**re**)inventions and implementations

## Reinventions

- [ddats](https://github.com/DineshDevaraj/ddats) - Python based async task scheduler, something similar to Celery.
- ddanl - Python based async network library. A drop in replacement for twisted.
- ddawf - Python based async web development framework. A drop in replacement for FastAPI.
- [ddjson](https://github.com/DineshDevaraj/ddjson) - C++ based JSON parser implemented using (RDP) recursive decendant parsing.
