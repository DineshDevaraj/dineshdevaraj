## Hi There ðŸ‘‹

- Polyglot programmer, learner by reinventing the wheel
- Below I have shown my (**re**)inventions and implementations

## Reinventions

- [ddaio](https://github.com/DineshDevaraj/ddaio) - Drop in replacement for Python built-in asyncio.
- [ddats](https://github.com/DineshDevaraj/ddats) - Python based async task scheduler, something similar to Celery.
- [ddjson](https://github.com/DineshDevaraj/ddjson) - C++ based JSON parser implemented using (RDP) recursive decendant parsing.

## Indigenous Ideas

- [ddpnx](https://github.com/DineshDevaraj/pnxengine) - C++, Yacc and Bison based app to generate values from regex like expression.
