## Hi There ðŸ‘‹

- I am a polyglot programmer
- I think reinventing the wheel is a best way to learn software

# Here are my reinventing projects

- ddanl - Python async network library. A replacement for twisted
- ddproxy - Python based UDP proxy
- ddjson - C++ based JSON parser implemented using (RDP) recursive decendant parsing
